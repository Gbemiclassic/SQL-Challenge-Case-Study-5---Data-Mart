## - 3. Before & After Analysis

This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.

Taking the `week_date` value of `2020-06-15` as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect. We would include all `week_date` values for `2020-06-15` as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before.

Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:

**1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after `2020-06-15`? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?**

First, we need to get the week number corresponding to `'2020-06-15'`

````sql
SELECT 
	DISTINCT week_number
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE week_date = '2020-06-15' 
AND calendar_year = '2020';
````

The week_number is 25. Then, we can apply filters for 4 weeks before as `week_number`  21 to 24 and after as `week_number` 25 to 28 for the before & after analysis

````sql
WITH cte AS (
SELECT
	SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 21 AND 24 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) before_change
    ,SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND 28 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) after_change
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE calendar_year = '2020'
)
SELECT
	 before_change
    ,after_change
    ,after_change - before_change AS diff_after_change
    ,CONCAT(ROUND(100 *((after_change / before_change) - 1), 2), '%') pct_diff_after_change
FROM cte;
````

After the introduction of the new sustainable packaging on `'2020-06-15'`, sales has dropped by $26,884,188 at -1.15%. 

***

**2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?**

We can apply the same logic and solution to this question. 

````sql
WITH cte AS (
SELECT
	SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 13 AND 24 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) before_change
    ,SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND 36 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) after_change
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE calendar_year = '2020'
)
SELECT
	 before_change
    ,after_change
    ,after_change - before_change AS diff_after_change
    ,CONCAT(ROUND(100 *((after_change / before_change) - 1), 2), '%') pct_diff_after_change
FROM cte;

````

By expanding the date range to 12 weeks before and after the implementation of the change, it becomes evident that there is an additional decrease in sales of approximately -2.14%. This decline translates to a significant drop of $152,325,394 in sales over the 12-week period.

**3. How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?**

- 4 weeks before and after comparison for 2018, 2019 and 2020.

````sql
WITH cte AS (
SELECT
	calendar_year
	,SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 21 AND 24 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) before_change
    ,SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND 28 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) after_change
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT
	 calendar_year
	,before_change
    ,after_change
    ,after_change - before_change AS diff_after_change
    ,CONCAT(ROUND(100 *((after_change / before_change) - 1), 2), '%') pct_diff_after_change
FROM cte;

````

For 2018 and 2019, there was an increase in sales within that period compared to 2020 where significant drop in sales at -1.15% was observed after the change. 


- 12 weeks before and after comparison for 2018, 2019 and 2020.

````sql
WITH cte AS (
SELECT
	 calendar_year
	,SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 13 AND 24 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) before_change
    ,SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND 36 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) after_change
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT
	 calendar_year
	,before_change
    ,after_change
    ,after_change - before_change AS diff_after_change
    ,CONCAT(ROUND(100 *((after_change / before_change) - 1), 2), '%') pct_diff_after_change
FROM cte;
````

While there was a slight decline in sales in 2019 within the period under review, a similar trend is observed to the 4-week before and after analysis. However, 2020 had a more significant drop in sales within the same period.
