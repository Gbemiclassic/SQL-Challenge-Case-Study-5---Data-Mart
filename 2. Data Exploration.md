## 2. Data Exploration

**1. What day of the week is used for each week_date value?**

````sql
SELECT 
	DISTINCT DATE_FORMAT(week_date, '%W') day_used
FROM clean_weekly_sales;
````

- Monday is used for each `week_date` value.

**2. What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?**
- First, generate a number series for the weeks of the entire year from 1st week to 52nd week using Recursive Cte and name it `complete_weeks`.
- Then, do a LEFT JOIN of `complete_weeks` with `clean_weekly_sales`, and filter that output to where `clean_weekly_sales.week_number` IS NULL.

````sql
WITH RECURSIVE complete_weeks AS
(
	SELECT 1 AS weeks 
	UNION ALL
	SELECT weeks + 1   
	FROM complete_weeks
	WHERE weeks < 52
)
SELECT weeks
FROM complete_weeks c
	LEFT JOIN clean_weekly_sales cws
		ON c.weeks = cws.week_number
WHERE cws.week_number IS NULL;

- 28 `week_number`s are missing from the dataset.

**3. How many total transactions were there for each year in the dataset?**

````sql
SELECT
	 calendar_year
	,SUM(transactions) total_transactions 
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY 1;

**4. What is the total sales for each region for each month?**

````sql
SELECT
	 region
	,month_number
	,SUM(sales) total_sales
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2;

**6. What is the percentage of sales for Retail vs Shopify for each month?**

````sql
SELECT
	 calendar_year
	,month_number
	,MONTHNAME(week_date) month
	,SUM(CASE WHEN platform = 'Retail' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) Retail_Sales
	,SUM(CASE WHEN platform = 'Shopify' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) Shopify_Sales
	,CONCAT(ROUND( 100 * SUM(CASE WHEN platform = 'Retail' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) / SUM(sales), 2), '%') pct_retail
	,CONCAT(ROUND( 100 * SUM(CASE WHEN platform = 'Shopify' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) / SUM(sales), 2), '%') pct_shopify

**7. What is the percentage of sales by demographic for each year in the dataset?**

````sql
SELECT
	 calendar_year
	,SUM(CASE WHEN demographic = 'Couples' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) Couples
	,SUM(CASE WHEN demographic = 'Families' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) Families
	,SUM(CASE WHEN demographic = 'Unknown' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) "Unknown"
	,CONCAT(ROUND( 100 * SUM(CASE WHEN demographic = 'Couples' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) / SUM(sales), 2), '%') pct_couples
	,CONCAT(ROUND( 100 * SUM(CASE WHEN demographic = 'Families' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) / SUM(sales), 2), '%') pct_families
	,CONCAT(ROUND( 100 * SUM(CASE WHEN demographic = 'Unknown' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) / SUM(sales), 2), '%') pct_unknown 
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY 1;

**8. Which age_band and demographic values contribute the most to Retail sales?**

````sql
SELECT
	 age_band
	,demographic
	,SUM(sales) Retails_sales
	,CONCAT(ROUND(100 * (SUM(sales) / SUM(SUM(sales)) OVER ()), 2), '%') pct_contribution
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE platform = 'Retail'
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
````

**Answer:**

<img width="650" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Gbemiclassic/SQL-Challenge-Case-Study-5---Data-Mart/blob/main/Images/Data%20Exploration/p8.jpg">

The highest retail sales contribution are by the unknown `age_band` and `demographic` at 40.52% followed by the Retiree Families and the Retiree Couples at 16.73% and 16.07% respectively.

**9. Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?**

- No, we cannot. Since, we have gotten the weekly avg_trans, aggregating further to yearly with give an untrue output. 
- We need to divide sales by transaction and group by year to get the true average transaction size for each year


````sql
SELECT
	 calendar_year
	,platform
	,ROUND(AVG(avg_transaction),0) AS avg_transaction_column
	,ROUND(SUM(sales)/sum(transactions), 2) AS avg_transaction_grouped
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2;
````

<img width="636" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Gbemiclassic/SQL-Challenge-Case-Study-5---Data-Mart/blob/main/Images/Data%20Exploration/p9.jpg">

The more accurate answer to find average transaction size for each year by platform would be `avg_transaction_group`.
